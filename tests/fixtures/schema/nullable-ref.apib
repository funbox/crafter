# My API

JSON schema of this document should define "data" property as a reference to the "Data" structure or as "null" type.
Thus, schema validation must allow to use object or null as a value of "data" property.

# Data Structures

## Data
+ a
+ b

# DataWrapper

+ data (Data, nullable)

# GET /foo

+ Response 200 (application/json)
  + Attributes
    + items (array[DataWrapper], required)
