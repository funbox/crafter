# My API

Defines attributes `person1`, `person2` and `person3` which inherit from fixed-type base structure or structure with required properties.
Some of properties redefined as optional.
Thus, the resulting json schema for `person1` should have only `first_name` and `id` as required properties (`last_name` is optional).
The resulting json schema for `person2` should not have any required property, since both properties defined as optional.
The resulting json schema for `person3` should have only `last_name` as required property (`first_name` is optional).
