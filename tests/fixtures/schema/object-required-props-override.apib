# My API

Defines attributes `person1` and `person2` which inherit from fixed-type base structure and have nested nested properties.
These properties identify themselves as optional.
Thus, the resulting json schema for `person1` should have only `first_name` and `id` as required properties (`last_name` is optional).
The resulting json schema for `person2` should not have any required property, since both properties defined as optional.
