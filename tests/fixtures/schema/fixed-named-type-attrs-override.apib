# My API

Defines cases where attributes of fixed-structure type "Person" are being overridden by nested attributes.

For the first case "Response 200", value of `last_name` should be an enumeration of "test" and "null" and value
of `middle_name` should be an enumeration of "another" (not "test").

For the second case "Response 300" all the same rules should be applicable.
