# My API

Defines a fixed-type array which contains a fixed recursive object. Resulting JSON Schema must declare all properties of the object
as required (including "parent" property).
Values of properties "first_name", "last_name", "middle_name" should be fixed and the value of the "parent" property should refer
to the structure "Person".

# Data Structures

## Person

+ `first_name`: `test` (string)
+ `last_name`: `test` (string)
+ `middle_name`: `test` (string)
